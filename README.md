This Pac-Man clone uses Java Swing, featuring smooth controls, AI-driven ghosts, and collision detection. Players collect food, avoid ghosts, and track their score and lives. The game resets on game over and runs on a JPanel-based loop for smooth updates. Great for learning Java 2D game development!
